# Test Assessment

The purpose of this simple exercise is to understand how a simple method can be tested.

In evaluating the response, we look for:
- the types of test cases.
- what edge cases may be covered.
- positive and negative test cases.
- inputs for tests.
- naming conventions for readability.
